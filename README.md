# TFS Extensions Command Line Utility

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/tfx-cli.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/tfx-cli)

This is a utility to manage extensions for TFS.  It is cross platform and supported on Windows, OSX and Linux.

*Pre-release but supported*

## Install
```bash
sudo npm install -g tfx-cli
```
<sub>Note: windows does not need sudo</sub>

## Help
Just type tfx.  It will list the commands and sub commands available
```bash
~$ tfx
```
![tfs-cli](docs/tfx-cli.png "TFS cross platform command line")

## Login
To avoid providing credentials in every command, you can login once.
Currently supported credential types are Personal Access Tokens and basic auth.
[Create a personal access token](http://roadtoalm.com/2015/07/22/using-personal-access-tokens-to-access-visual-studio-online) and paste it in the login command
```bash
~$ tfx login
Copyright Microsoft Corporation

Enter collection url > https://youraccount.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection
Enter personal access token > 
logged in successfully
```

You can alternatively use basic auth by passing `--authType basic` (read [Configuring Basic Auth](docs/configureBasicAuth.md)).  NTLM will come soon.

### Basic Auth for TFS
In order to use basic auth, you first have to enable basic auth on the TFS application tier IIS. Install the Basic Auth feature (if it is not installed) using Server Manager. Once it is installed, browse to the "tfs" application under the TFS website and enable Basic Auth. WARNING! Passwords are sent in clear-text when you enable basic auth.

Once you have enabled basic auth in IIS, you can then run `tfx login --authtype basic`. When prompted for username, use DOMAIN\USERNAME format (if you're on a Workgroup the DOMAIN will be the TFS machine name). Enter the password for the user when prompted for your password.

## Troubleshooting
To see detailed tracing output, you can set a value for the TFX_TRACE environment value and then run commands.  That may offer a clue into the problem.  It will certainly help if logging an issue.

<sub>Linux/OSX</sub>
```bash
export TFX_TRACE=1
```

<sub>Windows</sub>
```bash
set TFX_TRACE=1
```

<sub>PowerShell</sub>
```bash
$env:TFX_TRACE=1
```

setting `TFX_TRACE_CREDS=1` or `TFX_TRACE_CACHE=1` will trace out cred storage.  Typically those should not be set (to avoid leaking creds when sending traces).  Only set if you are troubleshooting credentials.
